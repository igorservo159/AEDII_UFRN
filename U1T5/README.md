## Project Description

This project aims to evaluate mobility around UFRN to determine optimal locations for installing bike-sharing dock stations. The analysis will focus on identifying key neighborhoods around the university that could benefit from such stations and assessing strategic placement options.

## Analysis Metrics

The study will utilize a range of network centrality metrics and related analyses to guide decisions, including:

- **Degree Centrality:** Measures how well-connected each neighborhood is within the network.
- **Number of Connections:** Counts direct connections of each neighborhood node.
- **Closeness Centrality:** Calculates the average distance from each node to all other nodes, assessing overall accessibility.
- **Betweenness Centrality:** Analyzes each neighborhood's position on the shortest paths, determining areas of intermediation.
- **Eigenvector Centrality:** Assesses each node's influence based on the importance of its neighbors.
- **Authority Score:** Reflects node authority by considering the connectivity to high-score neighbors.

## Statistical Analysis

The following methods will be applied to further refine and interpret centrality data:

- **CDF and PDF Analysis of Node Degrees:** This statistical approach will evaluate the distribution of connections, providing insights into connectivity patterns.
- **Multivariate Centrality Analysis:** A comprehensive, multivariable analysis will assess the interplay among different centrality metrics.

## Key Questions

1. **Which neighborhoods around UFRN should be prioritized for analysis?**
2. **Where are the optimal locations for dock-station placement?**
3. **Who constitutes the core and shell of the network?** (Identifying central versus peripheral areas within the network structure.)

This analysis will help inform decisions on bike-sharing infrastructure placement, ultimately supporting sustainable and accessible transportation solutions for the UFRN community and surrounding neighborhoods.
