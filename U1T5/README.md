## Project Description

This project aims to evaluate mobility around UFRN to determine optimal locations for installing bike-sharing dock stations. The analysis will focus on identifying key neighborhoods around the university that could benefit from such stations and assessing strategic placement options.

## Key Question
**Where are the optimal locations for dock-station placement?**

One way to answer it is to take into account the following network statistics:

### Analysis Metrics

- **Degree Centrality:** Number of connections of each neighborhood node.
- **Closeness Centrality:** Calculates the average distance from each node to all other nodes, assessing overall accessibility.
- **Betweenness Centrality:** Analyzes each neighborhood's position on the shortest paths, determining areas of intermediation.
- **Eigenvector Centrality:** Assesses each node's influence based on the importance of its neighbors.

### CDF and PDF Analysis of Node Degrees

- This statistical approach will evaluate the distribution of connections, providing insights into connectivity patterns.
  
### Multivariate Centrality Analysis

- A comprehensive, multivariable analysis will assess the interplay among different centrality metrics.

### Core/Shell

- **Who constitutes the core and shell of the network?** (Identifying central versus peripheral areas within the network structure.)
