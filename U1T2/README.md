**Getting UFRN articles data :globe_with_meridians:**

Searching in [Scopus](https://www.elsevier.com/products/scopus) database of articles and citations, I got the scopus.csv file containing information about articles published by authors from UFRN. The data was filtered by the fields of **computer science**, **engineering**, and **mathematics**, focusing on the following topics: **neural networks**, **artificial intelligence**, and **machine learning**.

The .csv file includes the following columns:
- Author names
- Unique author identifiers
- Article title
- Year of publication
