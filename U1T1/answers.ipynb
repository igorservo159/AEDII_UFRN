    "For \\( p_1(H) = 0.5 \\) and \\( p_2(H) = 0.5 \\), each possible outcome has a probability of 0.25. This is because the chance of getting heads or tails is the same for all combinations of the coins, meaning the desired outcome does not affect the probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For other values of \\( p_1(H) \\) and \\( p_2(H) \\), we multiply the probabilities of \\( p_1 \\) and \\( p_2 \\) corresponding to the desired results for coin 1 and coin 2:\n",

    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "We now need to find the probability \\( P(\\text{Not Spam} | \\text{Flagged}) \\). According to Bayes' Theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "P(\\text{Not Spam} | \\text{Flagged}) = \\frac{P(\\text{Flagged} | \\text{Not Spam}) \\cdot P(\\text{Not Spam})}{P(\\text{Flagged})}\n",

    "\n",
    "\\( P(\\text{Flagged}) \\) is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "P(\\text{Flagged}) = P(\\text{Flagged} | \\text{Spam}) \\cdot P(\\text{Spam}) + P(\\text{Flagged} | \\text{Not Spam}) \\cdot P(\\text{Not Spam})\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting the values:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "P(\\text{Flagged}) = (0.98 \\times 0.6) + (0.02 \\times 0.4) = 0.588 + 0.008 = 0.596\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can calculate \\( P(\\text{Not Spam} | \\text{Flagged}) \\):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "P(\\text{Not Spam} | \\text{Flagged}) = \\frac{0.02 \\times 0.4}{0.596} \\approx 0.01342\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the expected number of non-spam emails in the spam box is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Non-spam emails} = 0.01342 \\times 963 \\approx 12.93\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, out of 963 emails in the spam box, you should suspect that around **13 emails** are not spam.\n"
