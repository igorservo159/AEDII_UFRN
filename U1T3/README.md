### Do medicines in the same regulatory category tend to share more active ingredients?

#### Assortativity

Assortativity is a measure that indicates the tendency of nodes in a network to share similar characteristics. In the context of graphs, assortativity can be analyzed in relation to the attributes of the nodes, such as the regulatory category of medicines. If assortativity is high, it means that similar nodes tend to connect with each other, while low assortativity indicates that different nodes connect more frequently. This concept is crucial for understanding interactions in complex networks, such as that of medicines, where shared characteristics can impact the efficacy and safety of prescriptions.

#### Conclusion

When calculating the assortativity of the complete graph of the medicines network from the federal government database by ANVISA based on regulatory category, while considering only medications with a valid or active registration status, we obtained the value **assortativity = 0.36022898461592506**.

Although this is not a very high value, considering that assortativity can range from 0 to 1, this graph demonstrates a certain tendency to share more active ingredients among medications within the same regulatory category. The presence of thousands of medications, and consequently thousands of nodes in the graph, reinforces this observation. This finding suggests that regulatory frameworks may influence the formulation and distribution of medications, potentially guiding prescribers in selecting therapeutic options that share similar active components. Understanding the dynamics of such relationships can provide valuable insights for regulatory authorities and pharmaceutical stakeholders, helping to optimize medication management practices and enhance patient safety.
